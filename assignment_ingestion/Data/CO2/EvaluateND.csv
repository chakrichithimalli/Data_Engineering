chakrichithimalli,3,Provide your perspective on how ND is doing with respect to CO2 emissions given the data above along with other insight you might have.,"I can say North Dakota is doing ok with Co2 emissions from all fuels, but in terms of Co2 emissions from coal its on 12th place overall, some measures need to be taken to control Co2 emission from coal comapred to all  fuels and this can help in bringing the rank of ND from 35th position to higher,  some actions need to be taken and those should be impactful in reducing the Co2 emission level from coal as this seem to be one of the major contributor."
